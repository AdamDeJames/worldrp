1.1 Using cheats, hacks or abusing glitches will not be tolerated.
1.2 Double-accounting is not allowed and will likely result in a permanent suspension.
1.3 Do not reconnect, suicide, change job or do anything else to avoid a roleplay situation.
1.4 Do not insult or disrespect players or staff in Out-Of-Character chats.
1.5 Respect the staff’s decisions. You may discuss about it privately as long as you stick to the server rules.
1.5a Do not harass or disrespect the staff, this may lead to a heavier punishment than you have been dealt to already.
1.5b If you feel like your punishment is unfair, please make an unban/unblacklist request. You can discuss it there instead.
1.6 Scamming is not allowed. Also, do not steal items which other players have dropped to carry out a transaction.
1.7 When requesting an admin (@) you must provide relevant information. Non-informative, aggressive or caps-locked messages will result in a kick.
1.7a Do not make an @ request just because you are unhappy with the RP or because the RP has you at a disadvantage; unless someone is clearly breaking the rules or you think they are, making an illegitimate @ request just to complain or to try and get someone else in trouble will likely result in you being warned or punished.
1.8 Advertising products/servers is not permitted in any form, whether on OOC chat or on a steam name. 
1.9 If you see someone breaking the rules, try to warn them or contact an admin. Do not take the situation into your own hands (by for example arresting a player), as that counts as Backseat Administrating, and is bannable.
1.10 Do not reveal the presence of undercover admins to others on the server in the event that you notice them. Doing so will likely result in a kick.
1.11 Purposefully attempting to find loopholes in the rules will result in punishment.
1.12 You are not required to provide a reason for your RP actions to other players in OOC, even if they request it; you are only required to provide a reason for your RP actions to administrative staff when they ask. 
1.13 *UPDATED* You cannot be racist, sexist, and discriminatory (homophobic) OOC (Out Of Character).
1.13a *UPDATED* You cannot have a racist, sexist or discriminatory (homophobic) Steam Name. Doing such may result in a kick or if the situation calls for it, a ban.
1.13b *UPDATED* You can be racist, sexist, and discriminatory (homophobic) IC (In Character). However, do not do this to excess or if it doesn’t fit your character’s roleplay.]]
